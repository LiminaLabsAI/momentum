## Summary

Momentum is a spec-driven development toolkit for AI coding agents. It provides slash commands, agent rules, hooks, and templates that give any project a structured workflow: phase planning, backlog tracking, history logging, doc sync, and git discipline.

`momentum init` now scaffolds a fully navigable project in one command — specs skeleton, CLAUDE.md, agent rules, hooks, and all 11 commands. `momentum upgrade` keeps existing projects up to date with new releases.

## Active Phase

| Phase | Name | Status | Progress |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| 11 | Dynamic Orchestration & Context Handover | Planned, ready to start | Brainstorm complete 2026-06-07. Phase scaffold at `specs/phases/phase-11-orchestration-handover/`. Six groups: G0 foundations + capability flag cleanup → (G1 scout + G2 dispatch + G3 handoff in parallel) → G4 tracking contract integration → G5 per-adapter smoke + docs. Three invocation doors (slash + NL inference + CLI) over one shared `core/orchestration/` library. Live narration + persistent log. Tracking contract: cheap layer always auto, curated layer auto-if-meaningful, no new history entry types. ENH-023 + ENH-024 ride this phase in G0. Target v0.14.0. Run `/start-phase` when ready. |

> Phase 8 (Parallel Worktree Orchestration) was implemented on the
> `phase-8-parallel-worktrees` branch but has not been merged or
> released. Treat its status as "completed on branch, awaiting release
> decision" until that's resolved as a separate workstream.

## Upcoming Phases

| Phase | Name | Status | Key Deliverables |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| 12 | Reach | Not Started (target v0.15.0) | Adapter: Cursor (FEAT-007); Adapter: Gemini CLI (FEAT-008); ENH-009 distribution decision; adapter contract refinements |
| 13 | Intelligence | Not Started (target v0.16.0) | Self-learning hooks; retrospective-driven rule evolution; self-healing; context-window-aware task sizing |
| 14 | Platform | Not Started (target v1.0) | MCP server; `/specify`; `/decide` (ADR creation); skill authoring; dependency-aware tasks; bidirectional spec sync; ecosystem Tier 2 |

## Unscheduled Future Work

| Name | Stub | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Hardening & Activation | `specs/planning/unscheduled-hardening-activation.md` | Originally Phase 10. Displaced 2026-06-07. Scope: full systematic-debugging skill; SessionStart auto-activation; persuasion-hardening Rules 1/3/4/5/7/9; ENH-017. Pickable any time. |
| Parallel Stream Development | `specs/planning/unscheduled-parallel-streams.md` | Enable parallel feature work on a single project via git worktrees. Existing implementation on `phase-8-parallel-worktrees` branch (unmerged; needs reconciliation with Phase 10 state machine before merge). |
| Context Economy | `specs/planning/future-context-economy.md` | Trigger-gated. Pulled off the shelf only when concrete size/behaviour thresholds fire. |

## Next Actions

1. **`/start-phase` Phase 11 — Dynamic Orchestration & Context Handover** (target v0.14.0). Brainstorm complete; scaffold at `specs/phases/phase-11-orchestration-handover/`. Start with Group 0 (foundations + capability flag cleanup).
2. **cerebrio dogfood (post-v0.13.0 user action).** Bootstrap `../cerebrio-ecosystem/` via `momentum init --ecosystem cerebrio`; join sapience / frontend / py / cli / open-guard / open-shield / bench. Pointer-block updates land via separate per-repo `chore/ecosystem-pointer` PRs. Initiative `0001-memory-module` captures the 2026-06-05/06 Memory module v1 work retroactively.
3. Resolve Phase 8 (Parallel Worktree Orchestration) merge/release decision as a parallel workstream — implementation exists on `phase-8-parallel-worktrees` branch but was never released.
4. When Hardening & Activation becomes the right next thing, brainstorm from `specs/planning/unscheduled-hardening-activation.md`.

## Key Decisions Made

- Template-based install (file copy via install.sh) chosen for Phase 0 — simpler, no build tooling required; `npx momentum init` CLI deferred to Phase 2
- DIP architecture: `core/` (tool-agnostic logic) + `adapters/` (tool-specific wiring) — Phase 1 delivers this before the npx CLI so the CLI gets tool auto-detection for free
- Zero-dependency Node.js CLI — no `commander`, no `chalk`; only built-ins (`fs`, `path`, `process`)
- Package name `@avinash-singh-io/momentum` — `momentum` (unscoped) was taken on npm
- Claude Code only in Phase 2 — auto-detection deferred until more adapters land
- `install.sh` kept unchanged — npx CLI is additive, two install paths coexist
- `adapter.js` per coding agent (Option A) — DIP boundary for future adapters; consistent with `adapter.sh` pattern from Phase 1
- `brainstorm-project` split into `brainstorm-idea` (exploration, no files) + `start-project` (scaffolding) — mirrors `brainstorm-phase` → `start-phase` pattern

- **2026-05-08**: Phase 6 complete — v0.7.0 released. Adapter Contract v2 (per-agent commands/rules/scripts overlays, conflict = error); Rule 12 verify-before-claim; `/complete-phase` evidence rigor; `/review-code` (Claude Code, subagent-driven); ENH-014 cross-repo Rule 9 safeguards; `tests/` for momentum CLI (24 tests via node:test).
